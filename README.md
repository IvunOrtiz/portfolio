- [Material-UI-Carousel](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
- Github, LinkedIn, resume, and e-mail SVG icons from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com/icons/bubbles)
- SVG icons from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- Hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain from Google Domains

KNOWN BUGS
- Safari and iOS is not fully supported. SVG background does not transition for dark mode.
